6.824 Lab 2: Raft
Source: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-2.html

All of the base code in this repository can be attributed to MIT's 6.824 distributed systems course. The changes I have made are:
1. Re-structured the `raft` package to work with my `$GOPATH`.
2. Factored all of the essential code for lab 2 into this repository.
3. Created a `Makefile` to make running test commands easier to remember.
3. Filled in all below parts of this lab with my own code.
